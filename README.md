Place to put experimental scripts and notebooks

Code will have a data engineering emphasis. Source data used in the scripts and notebooks will be placed in the top-level data directory.
The Lahman baseball database (http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) was placed here, but I've found that the data
may need to be cleaned up a little and I may make edits to it (if so the changes will be tracked).
